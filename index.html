        <h1>Women in Computational Topology</h1>
        <p>Women in Computational Topology (WinCompTop) is a network and community for women and their
            allies in the field of computational topology.  Our goal is to provide resources both to
            women in the area and to the broader computational topology community, by showcasing the
            strong accomplishments and contributions of women in the discipline.
            On this site, youâ€™ll find listings of active women and their research focus, listings of upcoming
            events and workshops, and a record of past WinCompTop activities.</p>
