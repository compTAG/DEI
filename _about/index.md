Computational Topology is a growing research field encompassing the work of 
researchers from around the world with many different backgrounds. As a community, 
we value promoting and nurturing diversity, equity, and inclusion 
(DEI) of all people interested in pursuing research in this field. The DEI committee 
on computational topology, founded in Spring 2022, 
was created to help support DEI initiatives in the community.
