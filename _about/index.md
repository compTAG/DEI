Women in Computational Topology (WinCompTop)
is a network and community for women and their allies in the field 
of computational topology.  Our goal is to provide resources both to 
women in the area and to the broader computational topology community,
by showcasing the strong accomplishments and contributions of women in
the discipline.
On this site, youâ€™ll find listings of active women and their
research focus, listings of upcoming events and workshops, and a 
record of past WinCompTop activities.
