# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Computational Topology

A website for the support of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the Computational Topology community. Built using the Jekyll Doc Theme, and hosted using the gh-pages branch.

To contribute, first clone the repo, run git checkout gh-pages, and then edit the "about" section or the "conferences" section by editing .md files in the `_about` or `_conferences directories`. For each, the homepage is titled index.md, and additional pages corresponding to either section are otherwise named according to their contents.

Once a desired change has been made, commit it and push to the gh-pages branch. The live site will update in a few minutes thereafter.
