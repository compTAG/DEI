# Instructions for Contribution

Simply add to the desired markdown documents either in the `_about` or `_conferences` directory. The website hosted 
on Github renders these markdown files to display each of the subpages in the `about` and `conferences` sections.
After making the desired changes, commit them and push to the `gh-pages` branch, where they will automatically be
incorporated in a new deployment of the site.
