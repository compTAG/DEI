<p>I am an undergraduate researcher at MSU, involved in computational geometry and topology research. In Fall 2018 I joined the group <a href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/tda/">TDA at MSU</a>, and have since become involved in numerous projects. 
Our group meets each week to discuss fundamental topics, recent research papers, and current research of group members.
