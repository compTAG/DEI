<p>Brittany Fasy, Brad McCoy, David Millman, and I published a paper in CCCG 2020, titled 
<a href="../../assets/cccg20.pdf">If You Must Choose Among Your Children, Pick the Right One</a></p>

<p>Abstract: Given a simplicial complex K and an injective function f from the vertices of K to R, we consider algorithms that extend f to a discrete Morse function on K. 
We show that an algorithm of King, Knudson and Mramor can be described on the directed Hasse diagram of K. 
Our description has a faster runtime for high dimensional data with no increase in space.</p>
