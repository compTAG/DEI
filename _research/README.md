### CompTAG at MSU

The computational topology and geometry (CompTAG) group at MSU is focused on research projects
in applied topological data analysis and computational geometry. These projects are led by 
[Brittany Fasy](https://comptag.github.io/brittany-fasy/), [David Millman](https://www.cs.montana.edu/dave/mySite/index.html),
and [Binhai Zhu](https://www.cs.montana.edu/bhz/homepage.html). In particular, we are interested in the following subject areas:

* Problems regarding persistent homology techniques, whose general aim is to uncover topological features in point cloud data. We
are currently working on projects related closely to persistence diagrams, which are used to indicate the persistence of various
features in data.

* Problems related to homotopy area, and the development of efficient algorithms to find the minimum area swept out by continuously deforming
a closed curve in the plane to a point.

* Developing new techniques in discrete Morse theory, which attempts to generate functions indicative of the topology of a simplicial complex. 

* At the intersection of topology and statistics, where we are proving statistical properties of important topological descriptors.

* Applications in histology, where we are developing quantitative methodology for detecting geometric and topological features in point
clouds extracted from histology images. 
Currently, we are working on a project to advance towards a quantification of prostate cancer aggressiveness.

*  Biofilms Resources and Information Database, which will give biofilm researchers easier access to large amounts of data and analytical tools.
 
From discerning important shape properties of molecules to quantifying flocking behaviour in animals,
 and from categorizing various structures of the human anatomy to understanding the arrangement of the universe, 
computational topology and geometry techniques have major implications in countless STEM fields. 

Our group meets weekly to discuss fundamental topics, recent research papers, and the progress of research projects by group members. 
We are always excited about new applications of TDA and computational geometry, and welcome any interested students to join our weekly seminars.
