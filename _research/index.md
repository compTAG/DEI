I am an undergraduate researcher at MSU, involved in computational geometry and topology research. In Fall 2018 I joined the group [TDA at MSU](https://www.cs.montana.edu/tda/), and have since become involved in numerous projects. 
Our group meets each week to discuss fundamental topics, recent research papers, and current research of group members. 
For more information on specific projects I'm currently working on, be sure to navigate through the table on the left side of the page!
